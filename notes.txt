I will need to make a payment page to display the total and amounts of pizza using sessions

1. Session["FullPayment"] = "";
2. Session["Pepperoni"] = "";
3. Session["Margherita"] = "";

after they clicked payment, I will need to create a record of orders that has been created saying.
1. Pizza
2. Full Total
3. Customer name
4. (maybe) purchase date and time.
